# GamestopScraper

Welcome to the GameStop Scraper! This gem will allow you to scrape the listed newly released video games as well as those releasing soon. Each game gets scraped from the home page and instantiated as an accessible object. You can pull information about each of the games, such as price, ESRB rating, and more!

For run instructions, look in the Usage section.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gamestop_scraper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gamestop_scraper

## Usage

There are several other gems required for 'gamestop_scaper' to work, so make sure to run ```bundle install``` prior prior to use.

In order to run this program, run 'ruby bin/releases' in your command line.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
